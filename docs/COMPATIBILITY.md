# ATLAS Compatibility

This repository currently implements a GameDig-based heartbeat process only.

- Query protocol type: `atlas`
- Adapter release: `0.1.0`
- Tested game builds: none recorded yet.
- Tested server API/plugin versions: none recorded yet.
- Operating-system compatibility: pending isolated test.

Do not add a game build or server API version to `adapter.manifest.json` until it has been tested against the actual dedicated server. The manifest is metadata only; the Core plugin registry does not install or execute this process.
